# Pokédex

## Introduction
In search for Pokémon? You've come to the right place. Search for Pokémon using this Pokédex application.

## Information
This appllication is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux. SFML is required for this application to run properly. Specifically, the graphics and audio modules, of SFML, are used in this application.

The Pokédex is still a work in progress as there are still features to be added. However, it is fully functional to search for the first 56 Pokémons by their name or national Pokédex number.

## Instructions
The source files are provided, but a few of things need to be done in order to run this application properly.

1. [Download](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/) the appropriate version of SFML for your compiler.

2. Configure SFML for your integrated development environment (IDE) and create a project.

3. Ensure that the project's working directory is the project folder so that files paths, read, are relative to the project folder.

4. Download the Pokédex source files from Github and place them in your project folder.

5. Make sure that openal.dll (should be in the SFML folder you downloaded) is placed next to your project executable file. This ensures that the audio is working.
